        <p style ="background-color:pink">Makeup has evolved from years until now. People didnt wear makeup until the 1920'2. During the 1920's the girls would wear thin arched black eyebrows, heart shaped lips, pink blush in a circle on cheecks, and smudged eyeshadow. In addition, centuries ago women used burnt matches to darken their eyes, berries to stain their lips and young boys' urine to fade their freckles</p>
