        <p>My favorite Makeup artist has to be Kai-lani aka @viva_glam_kay if followed on Instagram. I give her a big spotlight not only for the work she does on makeup and hair but the heart she has because of the acts she does, Kay-lani makes her makeup amazing because she doesn't only pull of classy eyeshadow looks, but she also manages to make her hair combine with the makeup she wears. Her hometown is Orlando, Florida and is currently a divorced mom but has met someone and is with him. Kay-lani takes great care of her face with products, and shes always helping people in need or volunteering at events. Kay-Lani helped after the the Orlando shooting, and always brings up this topic on her videos. "I felt guilty because I was laughing and having a good time, while their was people dying and crying for their own lifes at that moment". When she said this it made me stop and think and realized that she had a big point. This is why I give a big shout out and spotlight on her.  </p>

    <p>Another spotlight goes to @Makeupholicmoon. Not only does she do amazing makeup and hair where the Arabic makeup looks inspire her, but she makes a lot of organic masks and concotions to put on her face and hair. She likes to have her face acne, oil, and blackheads free. Never will you see her using chemical products because she likes sticking with everything organic. One of her organic concoctions that work that I've tried is the blending of papaya and putting it on face and hair with a egg yolk and Almond milk on the hair to keep it smooth and shiny. Another one is the mixture of is pomegrade,clemantine, and honey to leave a natural glow on your face. </p>
   <p> Now Jeffree Star the one that I've known since I was in Elementary school, and it's crazy to think now on how much he has changed and done. He has practically done eveything as in acting, modeling, music, and makeup. He was born in Los Angeles, California and there was where he started experimenting with his moms makeup, which had brought his attention. Although he has been judged in life so much he continues forward and shines better than ever.  </p>
