    <h1>Makeup</h1>

    <div class="holder">
        <p style ="background-color:pink"> Makeup has evolved from years until now. People didnt wear makeup until the 1920'2. During the 1920's the girls would wear thin arched black eyebrows, heart shaped lips, pink blush in a circle on cheecks, and smudged eyeshadow. In addition, centuries ago women used burnt matches to darken their eyes, berries to stain their lips and young boys' urine to fade their freckles. By the 1920s, every pharmacy and department store had there makeup counters. More makeup was being made during the years making it more better, and at the beginning the makeup was becoming more refined on women</p>
    </div>
    <p style ="background-color:pink">Now in 2016 makeup has evolved into many ways. Lots of young girls are wearing makeup due to the common name "Fleeky". Now with so much technology girls are using youtube to make or watch makeup tutorials. Contouring is a ashade darker than yours and a color about 2 tones lighter than yours. This technique makes your face pop out, define, or reshape any part of your face. Eyebrows have also become a popular thing in which girls have fleek(on point) eyebrows by shaping them out with either a brow pencil, brow gel, or any other product to shape your eyebrows. Eyeshadow and eyeliner is also another trend the eyeshadow must be blended right and then comes the sharp eyeliner, and if you prefer using mascara or eyelashes either is fine.  </p>
   <p style ="background-color:pink">Some of my favorite makeup artist today is Jeffree Star, Manny Mua, Nikki, Habiba, and my most favorite Kay-Lani. I have learned a alot from many makeup tutorials, but these people are the ones that taught me the most and now I am way better then ever. I like Jeffree because he likes to have fun with the makeup and likes to pop out, and Nikki also is the same as him because she pulls of really noticeable and pretty looks. Manny because he does less of the pop out but keeps it decent, and the eyeshadows he blends colors that really go along together. However, Habiba not only does pretty makeup between classy and ones that really pop out, but she takes care of her face a lot by making concoctions to make her face acne free, shiny, and free from blackheads. Finally Kay-lani makes her makeup amazing because she not only pull of classic eyeshadow looks and contour she also manages to make her hair combine with the makeup she wears. Kay-lani also also takes care of her face with products, and shes always helping people in need or volunteering at events.  </p>
