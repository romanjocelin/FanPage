        <p> Makeup has evolved from years until now. People didnt wear makeup until the 1920'2. During the 1920's girls would wear thin arched black eyebrows, heart shaped lips, pink blush circles on cheecks, and smudged eyeshadow. In addition, centuries ago women used burnt matches to darken their eyes, berries to stain their lips and young boys urine to fade their freckles. By the 1920s, every pharmacy and department store had makeup counters. More makeup was being made during the years making it more better, and at the beginning the makeup was becoming more refined on women.</p>

    <p>Now in 2016 makeup has evolved into many ways. Lots of young girls are wearing makeup and are using the term "Fleeky", which means makeup on point. Now with so much technology girls are using youtube to make or watch makeup tutorials. Contouring is a shade darker than you skin color and a color about 2 tones lighter than yours. This technique makes your face pop out, define, or reshape any part of your face. Eyebrows have also become a popular thing in which girls have fleek(on point) eyebrows by shaping them out with either a brow pencil, brow gel, or any other product to shape your eyebrows. Eyeshadow and eyeliner is also another trend the eyeshadow must be blended right and then comes the sharp eyeliner, and you choose between using just mascara or falsies  </p>
